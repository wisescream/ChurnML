# Data Management

This project separates source data from derived artifacts to keep the repository lightweight and reproducible.

- `raw/` contains immutable source files that can be versioned in Git when they are small enough. Large files should be added with `dvc add` and stored in the configured remote.
- `processed/` holds derived datasets generated by the DVC pipeline (`dvc repro`). The directory is kept in Git for structure only; its contents are ignored and reproducible from code.

To refresh processed assets locally:

```powershell
# ensure dependencies are installed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# reproduce the pipeline
dvc repro
```

To push large artifacts to remote storage:

```powershell
# upload the latest versions of tracked data and models
dvc push
```
